# YouTube Converter

A first independent project for practice.

This will be a standalone YouTube converter with a graphical user interface (tkinter).

It will require ffmpeg to combine audio and video streams that are downloaded from pytube. It only works with DASH Streams, not Progressive streams which combine
both video and audio streams natively, up to 720p video quality.
